some Python projects to show my knowledge of the language

 ## codec.py/steganography.py
- are part of an image encoding project that lets users write messages into images using steganography. It is all done with binary
- encoding into images, there are also three different types of encoding in the project including Huffman encoding and Caesar shift.

## player.py/board.py
- are part of a version of the typical game of tic tak toe. This version however lets the user choose who to play against. Whether that
- be against another player, a simple AI that just places its mark on the board, or a smart AI that is very difficult to beat and never
- loses.
